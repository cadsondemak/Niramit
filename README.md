Niramit
Formal text face skeleton with an old world twist. Niramit is using the modern structure with a decorative added on details. The proportion is a cleaner version of typical text face of hot metal type era made to fit with today style of digital drawing. Originally designed by Akarameytee aka Pairoj Peamjakapong and Bavorn Joradol, the team behind the typeface “Srisakdi”. Fit well with  old classic typography and a good representative of classic voice for today’s context.
